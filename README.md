Final Project

## Contents of this Repository

An R-Markdown file (`.Rmd`) has an associated PDF.

`hw11q6.R` - initial investigation of data for Homework 11, Question 6

`writeup2.Rmd` - script that loads all the data, explores it and does the analysis. This script
  also generates the writeup2.R file to be submitted.

`onepage.Rmd` - one page handout that explains the dataset and summarizes the analysis

`ethicalIssues.Rmd` - one-page document that discusses the ethical issues raised by conclusions reached from analysis of the data.

`submission/` - directory where we'll stage what has to be delivered into Canvas

In the submission directory, `writeup2.Rmd` has been renamed `highlights.Rmd` (same goes for the PDF).
The generated `writeup2.R` was renamed `longscript.R`. All the data files were put into a single zip.

## TODO

To submit:

* [x] A .csv with the dataset (`data.zip`)
* [x] A long, well-commented script that loads the dataset, explores it and does all the analysis (`writeup2.R`)
* [x] A shorted .Rmd with compiled .pdf that presents the highlights in ten minutes (`writeup2.Rmd`)
* [x] A one-page handout that explains the dataset and summarizes the analysis (`onepage.Rmd`)
* [x] A one-page document that discusses ethical issues raised by conclusions reached from analysis of the data (`ethicalIssues.Rmd`)
