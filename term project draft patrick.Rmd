## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
cur <- read.csv("data/crypto.csv"); head(cur)

index <- which(cur$Symbol=="LTC")
ltc <- cur[index,]; head(ltc)
var(ltc$Close) #variance of 5.495 x 10^-5
ltc <- ltc[c(0:691), c(1:8)]

index <- which(cur$Symbol=="ETH")
eth <- cur[index,]; head(eth)
var(eth$Close) #variance of 0.000600
length(eth$Close)
cov(ltc$Close, eth$Close) #covariance of 2.635 x 10^-5

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#NOTE: Run this chunk all at once or there will be an error saying new.plot needs to be called
ltcvalue <- ltc$Close; ethvalue <- eth$Close
cor(ltcvalue,ethvalue)    #weak positive/no correlation cor =0.33
plot(ethvalue,ltcvalue,pch = ".",cex = 3)  #confirmed by scatter plot
#Find the regression line y = a + bx

#Here is the formula for the slope of the line
b <- sum( (ethvalue-mean(ethvalue))*(ltcvalue-mean(ltcvalue)) / sum((ethvalue-mean(ethvalue))^2));b 
#Alternative - works because division by n-1 cancels out
cov(ethvalue,ltcvalue)/var(ethvalue)
#Here is the formula for the intercept
a <- mean(ltcvalue) - b*mean(ethvalue);a    
#We can add this regression line to the plot of the data
abline(a, b, col = "red")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
